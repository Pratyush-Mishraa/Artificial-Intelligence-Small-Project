# Artificial-Intelligence-Small-Projects-
It have many smaller project for new learning students of AI and Data Science

This repository contains the project of AI basic which I learned through practices and all the projects are done in either local editor or Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/) using Python Language.

As a student you are advised to first learn the basics of AI and Python then go through the codes.
